# QMP
Quick Media Player - A JavaFX based media launcher for live settings

## Introduction

The need for this came about when streaming church services during
lockdown. It turned out surprisingly difficult to drag a media
player into the right place on an extended dropbox, maximise it to
fill that screen, and get it playing, in a professional looking way.

So that's what QMP does; it lets you build a list of media clips
you may want to play, and launch them with a double click at a
pre-defined location, scaled to a given size, in a border-less
window.

Being JavaFX-based, it is (hopefully) platform-independent code,
(although I've been developing with Windows). It was written
pretty quickly, so is untidy here and there, and there are a few
simple issues that could be fixed with a small amount of code...
